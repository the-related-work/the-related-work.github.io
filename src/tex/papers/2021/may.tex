\subsubsection*{Decoding with Value Networks for Neural Machine Translation}\label{paper:he2017decoding}

\paragraph{Content}
This work introduces \textsc{NMT-VNN}~\cite{he2017decoding}, which incorporates a value network in machine translation decoding. The value network $v(X, Y)$ is trained to distinguish the better partial decoding  between two partial decoding $Y^{p,1}$ and $Y^{p,2}$ generated by beam search with a certain model $\pi(y|X, Y)$. The discrimination is based on the average BLEU score of complete target sentences of $Y^{p,1}$ and $Y^{p,2}$. At each step $T$ of the decoding phase, they maximize
\begin{equation}\label{eq:he2017decoding:1}
    \alpha\frac{\sum_i^T \log P(y_i|X, Y_{< i})}{T} + (1-\alpha) \log v(X, Y_{\le T})
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the balancing factor.


\paragraph{Comment}
The idea of this work is promising, where they intend to foresee the future result of current selection in machine translation.

We shall start our analysis by interpreting what $v(X,Y)$ stands for here. Derived from the original paper, they train it by minimizing
\begin{equation}\label{eq:he2017decoding:2}
    \exp \left( \left(v(X, Y^{p,1}) - v(X, Y^{p,2})\right) \mathrm{sign}\left(\mathrm{FutureBLEU}(Y^*, Y^{p,2}) - \mathrm{FutureBLEU}(Y^*, Y^{p,1})\right) \right)
\end{equation}
When $v(X, Y)$ can correctly assign values for arbitrary partial decoding, function~\ref{eq:he2017decoding:2} reaches global minima. Thus this objective seems reasonable. We can further infer that considering the current $v(X, Y_{< T, i})$ and $v(X, Y_{< T, j})$ is sufficient to compare the future performance of $Y_{< T, i}$ and $Y_{< T, j}$.

However, in their experiments, we see that the best values of $\alpha$ \begin{enumerate}
    \item are large ($\ge 0.8$).
    \item are different across tasks.
\end{enumerate}
This may indicate that, in practice, the value network $v(X, Y)$ plays a less important role than our expectation. The reasons are currently unknown, but I hypothesize the major reason comes from insufficient training of $v(X,Y)$.
